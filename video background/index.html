           <p>If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, 
               and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come,

                  and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, 
                  there was no man there.6 For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses,
                   even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, 
                  the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, 
                  and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, 
                  and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</p>
